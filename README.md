## Blind Auction

A program that will collect the names and bids of different people. The program should ask for each bidder's name and their bid individually. Then at the end will display the winner of the auction in such a way that the other players are not able to know what other players have entered as bid amount

## Example 
```
Welcome to the secret auction program. 
What is your name?: Angela
```
```
What's your bid?: $123
```
```
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

```
If there are other bidders, the screen should clear, so you can pass device to the next person. If there are no more bidders, then the program should display the name of the winner and their winning bid. 

```
The winner is Elon with a bid of $55000000000
```
